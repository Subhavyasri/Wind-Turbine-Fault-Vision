# 🌬️ Wind Turbine Fault Vision

## 🔍 Project Overview
Wind Turbine Fault Vision is an image classification project designed to automatically detect faults in wind turbine blades using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
This project aims to support sustainable energy management by enabling early fault detection and predictive maintenance of turbines.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Wind turbine blades often experience wear, cracks, or damage due to environmental stress. Manual inspection is time-consuming and risky.  
Our goal is to develop a **CNN-based automated vision system** to classify images of wind turbine blades into:
- 🟢 Normal
- 🔴 Faulty
