🌬️ Wind Turbine Fault Vision
🔍 Project Overview

Wind Turbine Fault Vision is an image classification project designed to automatically detect faults in wind turbine blades using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
This project supports sustainable energy management by enabling early fault detection and predictive maintenance of turbines.

🧩 Problem Statement

Wind turbine blades often experience cracks, erosion, or surface damage due to continuous exposure to harsh environmental conditions.
Manual inspection is time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unsafe.
This project proposes a CNN-based automated vision system to classify turbine blade images as:

🟢 Normal

🔴 Faulty

🧠 Technical Domain

Machine Learning / Deep Learning

Image Classification

Computer Vision (CNNs)

📂 Dataset Access

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Google Drive:
👉 Wind Turbine Fault Detection Dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Zn60vVMgs9bmVOTnYoY-MUqF1kg1JGz/view?usp=sharing)

This dataset will be used for training, testing, and validation of the CNN model.
